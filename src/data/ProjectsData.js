        description: ["<p>In my role at the Asociacion Chilena de Seguridad, I encountered a pressing challenge: revitalizing the company's intranet to enhance internal communication and engagement. The existing platform suffered from a disjointed structure, hindering collaboration and information dissemination across departments and offices.</p><p>Upon assessment, it became evident that the intranet's chaotic categorization of content was a significant barrier to employee engagement. To address this, I proposed a comprehensive overhaul of the content architecture, guided by principles of user experience (UX) design.</p><p>Central to the redesign was the creation of distinct sections tailored to meet the diverse needs of employees. We began by establishing a dedicated area for new employees, providing essential resources and information to streamline their onboarding process. This included insights into company culture, benefits, and HR contact details, enabling newcomers to navigate their roles more efficiently.</p><p>In addition to the new employee section, we reorganized the intranet to prioritize company-wide communication, idea sharing, and feedback mechanisms. By centralizing these resources, we fostered transparency and collaboration across departments, facilitating smoother workflows and knowledge exchange.</p><p>Furthermore, we introduced department-specific sections, offering targeted information and resources tailored to the unique requirements of each team. This included financial tools for the Accounting department, safety protocols for the Safety department, and specialized forms for service requests.</p><p>The impact of the intranet redesign was profound. User engagement metrics saw a significant uptick, with employees embracing the platform as a vital resource in their daily activities. Notably, the introduction of the new employee section led to accelerated onboarding processes and enhanced internal knowledge sharing, resulting in improved efficiency and productivity company-wide.</p><p>By reimagining the intranet's structure through a UX lens, we transformed it from a disjointed platform into a cohesive and user-centric hub that empowered employees and facilitated seamless communication and collaboration. This project underscored the importance of thoughtful design and user-focused solutions in enhancing organizational effectiveness and employee satisfaction.</p>"],

        description: ['<p>In the bustling city of Malaga, Spain, I found myself taking on an unexpected role: hosting an Airbnb. What began as a favor for a friend turned into a fascinating journey of improving guest experiences through the lenses of UX and service design.</p><p>Upon arrival, I noticed the untapped potential for enhancing the guest experience. While the Airbnb functioned well, there were minor pain points that could be addressed to elevate the overall stay. Leveraging the Airbnb review system as a feedback mechanism, I embarked on a mission to streamline and enhance every aspect of the guest journey.</p> <p>One common issue was confusion around simple domestic tasks, such as operating the kitchen appliances or navigating the property. By applying the scientific method, I identified pain points and implemented straightforward solutions, such as placing instructional stickers on doors for easy access.</p><p>Addressing noise complaints, I revised the house rules to specify from "No Noise after 22:00" to a new "No noise in -the hallway- after 22:00", encouraging guests to gather in communal areas like the living room and movie areas. This not only fostered interactions among guests but also led to more positive reviews and extended stays.</p> <p>To promote socialization, I revamped the balcony area, making it a comfortable and inviting space for guests to connect. By arranging seating and encouraging guests to linger, I transformed the balcony into a hub of social activity while mitigating issues like trash accumulation through strategic signage.</p><p>Recognizing the value of fostering a friendly atmosphere for the improvements of the User/Guest Experience, I organized dinners and themed gatherings, creating opportunities for guests to bond and forge lasting connections. This shift from a transient lodging experience to a community-oriented space resulted in glowing extended reviews and increased referrals from our guest. Many of them even made actual friends that still got connections with.</p><p>When my tenure as Airbnb host concluded, I had elevated the property`s rating from 4.1 to 4.7, earning it a coveted recommendation status. This experience outside my typical tech-focused realm underscored the importance of client management, UX, and service design in shaping memorable experiences, regardless of the setting.</p>'],
